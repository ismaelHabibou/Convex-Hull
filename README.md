# Convex-Hull
The convex hull problem is a computational geometry problem. It has a wide range of applications. One the application of the convex hull is in image processing where it is used to find the set of pixels inside the smallest polygon.
I have solved the problem using two famous algorithms: Gift-wrapping and Graham algorithm. It was hard to implement the two algorithms because I had to revise some mathematics (determinant) but I finally I did it.
I can still improve my solution by using array instead of list because retrieving elements from an array is way faster that retrieving from a list.
